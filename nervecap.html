      <h2>Summary</h2>
    </div>
    <p>SYMPTOMATIC END NEUROMA is an impairing sequela of nerve amputation and transection injuries. The authors propose a medical device to prevent painful neuroma by “capping” terminal nerve ends. </p>
    <p>A neuroma forms after peripheral nerve injury followed by improper intrinsic repair. The resultant tumor is a bulbous mass of entangled axon fibers and non-neural tissue [1]. Neuroma occurs most commonly at nerve ends where it is associated with residual limb pain in 61&#x25; – 74&#x25; of cases [2]. Neuroma pain is resistant to most pharmacologic analgesic methods; thus surgical management is often elected. There is no consensus on how to best treat an already formed neuroma. Tumor excision followed by transposition of the nerve end into bone or muscle has varying success rates; 40&#x25; – 81&#x25; for intraosseous transposition and 33&#x25; – 91&#x25; for intramuscular transposition, respectively [3], [4]. Moreover, transposition is not always anatomically possible and requires the dissection of otherwise healthy tissue. Another technique, traction neurectomy, is favored for its simplicity but is associated with neuroma recurrence ranging from 15&#x25; – 50&#x25; and a reoperation rate of 47&#x25; [2], [5]. The American Society for Peripheral Nerve concluded traction neurectomy was not optimal, and the efforts of many groups to seek better treatments for symptomatic end neuroma are justified. </p>
    <p>The proposed device is a nerve cap intended to protect terminal nerve ends <i>at the time of injury</i> where repair is unattainable or undesired. The nerve cap is a surgical implant that is a tubular device with one open end and one sealed end (cap). The device secures over the nerve end and separates it from the surrounding soft tissue bed, isolating the exposed nerve structures from external mechanical stimuli and neurotrophic signaling. The cap is a bovine pericardial-derived matrix that remodels during the healing process, thereby enveloping nerve end regeneration to prevent neuroma. </p>
    <p>The anticipated FDA regulatory pathway is a Premarket Notification. The Axoguard Nerve Cap and Polyganics Neurocap precede this device as legally marketed Class II medical devices. The authors’ proposed design is comparatively simple and differentiated in material composition.</p>
    <p>User population essentially comprises all persons with a nerve amputation or unrepairable transection injury. An estimated 185,000 limb amputations are performed annually in the United States, with postoperative painful neuroma incidence at 15&#x25; [6], [7]. </p>

      <h2>Introduction</h2>
    </div>
    <p>Neuroma is defined as a benign proliferation of neural tissue. It is widely accepted that perineurial damage permits neuroma formation, as without an intact perineurium, axons are free to escape. As the axons regenerate into the extraperineurial space and damaged tissue, compounds released during inflammation can aid neuroma formation. Terminal nerve ends are especially susceptible to neuroma as regenerative Schwann cells lack a distal target to direct regeneration to. Allodynia and hyperalgesia symptoms of neuroma are frequently debilitating with considerable effects, such as precluding the successful use of a prosthetic. Mechanical stimulation often amplifies pain [1]. </p>
    <p>Etiology:<br>
      <br>1. Nerve injury/degenerating axons
      <br>2. Axonal sprouts
      <br>3. Unorganized bundles of axons
      <br>4. Bulbous mass of neural and non-neural tissue </p>
    <p>Therapies such as non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and local anesthetic injections are mostly ineffectual and do not solve the underlying issue [1]. Variable success rates of nerve transposition and traction neurectomy prompted autologous and device-based solutions. Some success was found in silicone and synthetic polymer caps but such materials illicit significant foreign body reaction (FBR). Autologous capping eliminated FBR risk, but the harvest of vein or epineurium demands additional operative time, and a potential limitation is tissue degradation. Newer techniques such as targeted muscle regenerating (TMR) and regenerative peripheral nerve interface (RPNI) demonstrated promising results in limited human trials, but are also complex surgeries that require additional training [2]. </p>

    <p>- Tubular device with one open end and one sealed end
      <br>- Composed of acellular bovine pericardium
      <br>-	Inner diameters of 1.5 mm, 2 mm, 2.5 mm, 3 mm, 4 mm, 5 mm, 6 mm, 7 mm, and 8 mm
      <br>-	Total length is 20 mm, with 8 mm – 12 mm of gap space or “runway” to fatigue regenerating axon fibers
      <br>-	Thickness is 0.5 mm
      <br>-	Sealed end (cap) is thickened to 3 mm to permit suture </p>
    <p>The nerve cap is indicated to protect a peripheral nerve end or stump and to separate the nerve from its surrounding environment to reduce the development of symptomatic or painful neuroma. When hydrated, the cap is flexible, pliable and non-friable. Basic surgical technique involves debridement of the nerve stump and measurement of its diameter to determine the appropriate cap, accounting for postoperative swelling. Once hemostasis of the nerve end is attained, it should be entubulated by passing suture through the wall of the nerve cap and transversely through the nerve epineurium. The suture is reversed back through the nerve and cap wall, and the nerve end is pulled into the cap to a length of at least 5 mm, ensuring that the nerve is aligned within the cap. The suture is tied securely. Additional suture may be used as needed, including at the sealed end to secure the device away from the injury site. </p>
    <p>The authors hypothesize that pericardium—a strong, double-layered membrane—can effectively isolate nerve end regeneration with minimal FBR compared with Polyganics Neurocap bioabsorbable synthetic polymer. Compared with the Axoguard Nerve Cap, this design has no internal guidance structures and lacks a distal end tab. The authors conjecture that the partition within the Axoguard Nerve Cap may adversely direct pathophysiological axonal regeneration. Further, a thin end “tab” extending from the cap may be a potential source of mechanical failure, especially when sutured into.</p>
